# vatprc-docs

This is the code for VATPRC's Homepage.

## Contributing

### Docs / SOP

The docs are placed under `docs/`. All markdown documents there are immediately
available on our website under <https://www.vatprc.net/docs>, despite there is no
listing for all docs.

For SOP docs, it requires review first by VATPRC3, and after VATPRC3 approves, it
requires assigning to VATPRC5 for approval. If both approved, the merge request
can be merged at discretion.

#### Image

Please use an online image service, and include the absolute link to it.
